# React Dashboard Framework

## Built using React + TypeScript + Vite

## Setup

To setup the project, run the following command in your command line:
`npm install` or `yarn install`
Then run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to execute the app in your browser.

## Content Configuration

There is a `config.ts` file located in the `src/assets` folder. By changing the different properties, or adding more similar items into the array of columns, one can manipulate the number of columns and widgets, as well as the data that is displayed on the dashboard.

## Overview

This project was built with the aim of creating a starting framework/library for reusable dashboard components. With the content managed through a configuration file to set the number of columns, amount of widgets, and different data displayed.

## Improvements

Due to the short timeframe, I could only complete the things being asked in the requirements checklist. But if given more time, I could do some more refactoring, optimizations, componentizing on some parts of the code, as some parts I felt I rushed on. The mobile responsiveness could be improved. Libraries and tools that I used, I could replace with more efficient tools like Tailwind CSS for the styling, React Server Components or Tanstack React Query for fetching the API data, and more improvements on the UI rendering and perhaps more unit/integrations tests.
